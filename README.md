# IAGuide
The International Academy App - iOS
So far, this app shows current location in the school (International Academy Central), 
room locations and schedules, teacher schedules, A day/B day info, weekly events (updated by the school's iCal file),
and some other small stuff. Please feel free to add your own touches to the app... or maybe even make an android version!

How to look through the code without Xcode
- Most classes are in the IAGuide Folder (things like tests and info.plist are usually not that improtant)
- Some classes are right inside the root folder. I actually dont know why things are organized like this...
- Any .h (header) or .m (implementation) file is pretty much where the magic happens (swift is going to take over later)
