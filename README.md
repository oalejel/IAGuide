The International Academy App - iOS
So far, this app shows current location in the school (International Academy Central), 
room locations and schedules, teacher schedules, A day/B day info, weekly events (updated by the school's iCal file),
and some other small stuff. Please feel free to add your own touches to the app... or maybe even make an android version!
